      <p>
        Greetings! I'm Rona, a work-in-progress minimalist. Two lovely feline
        companions share my life: Sesame, a male blue Korat, and Yuki, a female
        blue-point Siamese. My educational background includes a BASc with a
        specialization in Autism and Behavioral Science. However, after working
        in this field for about a year, I felt mentally and physically drained.
        That's when I decided to step back and embark on a new learning journey.
        It was during this time that I discovered U of T's Full Stack Bootcamp.
        I'm thrilled to share with you some of the projects I've accomplished
        throughout my bootcamp experience.
